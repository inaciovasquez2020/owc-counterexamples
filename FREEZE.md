# FREEZE DECLARATION

Status: FROZEN
Date: 2026-02-23

Scope:
- Repository contents are frozen at tag v0.2.
- No new witnesses will be added without an upstream assumption change
  or an explicit external proposal.

Allowed changes:
- Documentation cross-links
- Errata clarifications that do not alter semantics
- CI maintenance (non-semantic)

Disallowed changes:
- New witnesses
- Reclassification of existing witnesses
- Changes to verification semantics

Rationale:
This repository serves as a bounded, reviewer-safe counterexample
and boundary suite for OWC-related claims.
